The provided Python script performs clustering on a crime dataset using both hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering. Here's a breakdown of the steps and the process followed in the script:

1. Data Loading and Cleaning:
The dataset is loaded using pd.read_csv() from the given file path. The dataset includes columns for different crime statistics (e.g., Murder, Assault, UrbanPop, Rape) across various states.
The 'Unnamed: 0' column, which represents the state names, is dropped as it doesn't contribute to the clustering process.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Pairplot: A pairplot is created using seaborn to visualize relationships between the features.
PDF and CDF: Probability density function (PDF) and cumulative density function (CDF) are calculated and plotted for the 'Murder' column.
Boxplot: Boxplots are used to identify outliers in the features. The 'Rape' column is found to have outliers, which are handled by applying the IQR method to remove extreme values.
3. Normalization:
The dataset is normalized using a custom norm_fun() function that scales the features to a range of 0 to 1, ensuring that no feature dominates due to differing scales.
4. Hierarchical Clustering:
Dendrogram: A dendrogram is plotted using hierarchical clustering (linkage() from scipy) to visually determine the optimal number of clusters.
Clustering: The AgglomerativeClustering method is used to perform hierarchical clustering with n_clusters=3 (based on the dendrogram).
5. K-means Clustering:
Elbow Method: The optimal number of clusters is determined using the "elbow method." The total within-cluster sum of squares (TWSS) is calculated for a range of cluster numbers (from 2 to 7), and the "elbow" in the TWSS plot is used to choose the ideal number of clusters.
Clustering: K-means clustering is applied with the chosen number of clusters, and the labels are assigned to each state.
6. Saving the Results:
The results of both clustering methods (hierarchical and K-means) are saved to a CSV file for further analysis.
Key Points:
Normalization is crucial to ensure all features contribute equally to the clustering process.
Outliers are handled by limiting the 'Rape' column values using the IQR method.
The elbow method helps to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-means clustering.
Observations:
The optimal number of clusters for both hierarchical clustering and K-means may vary, but the elbow method suggests a suitable number for K-means, and the dendrogram visually confirms a reasonable choice for hierarchical clustering.
Potential Improvements:
You can further refine the outlier treatment strategy, especially if there are more columns with outliers.
Perform more advanced scaling techniques like Standardization (Z-score normalization) if needed, as it may better handle outliers.
You can also try different clustering methods, such as DBSCAN or Gaussian Mixture Models, to compare the results.
